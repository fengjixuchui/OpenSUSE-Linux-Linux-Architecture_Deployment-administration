# so we can get idle time for available memory 

Now the confusing thing comes out.

I will use AB (ApacheBench)  to run a test.
Simulate the situation of 500 concurrent client visit.

```
ab -n 10000 -c 500 http://0.0.0.0/index.xxxxxx
```

after run this test command in the client computer.

The server's httpd process increased to 175.

```
ps -ef | grep httpd | wc -l
175
```

# then during this ab test, run free again to monitor the memory usage:

```
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:       2964056    2828572     135484          0     231684    2075648
-/+ buffers/cache:     521240    2442816
Swap:      2097144        104    2097040
```

available memory now is =2442816 / 1024 =2385MB.

idle memory usage 2605MB - busy time memory usage 2385MB = 220MB.  Apache server increased nearly 160 child processes. but the memory usage only increased only 220MB memory usage.
# According to the top command output, we know that each httpd child process will consume 10Mb memory nearly. so 160 httpd child processes will reach to 1600MB memory usage.
