If you’re a Linux user, you may have seen zombie processes shambling around your processes list. You can’t kill a zombie process because it’s already dead – like an actual zombie.

Zombies are basically the leftover bits of dead processes that haven’t been cleaned up properly. A program that creates zombie processes isn’t programmed properly – programs aren’t supposed to let zombie processes stick around.
